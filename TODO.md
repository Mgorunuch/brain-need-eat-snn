- [ ] Initial connections generation (not all in a row to all in next row)
- [ ] "In progress" connections generation. Connections will be generated in runtime
- [ ] "In progress" connections destroying
- [ ] Increasing connection efficiency on every signal pass
- [ ] Breaking neurons generation. (normal neuron, but with negative potential)
- [ ] Breaking neuron positioning.
- [ ] Recreating neurons without connections when neurons not action within a long time.

#### Need think about this
> In the next case, we have a problem with one global idea. Yes, neurons communicate with each other, but they are separate systems that live in "their own world".
>
> Also we have a problem with brake neurons. How they will work? Increase spike efficiency when neuron not gained spike? It`s bad, because break neurons will increase efficiency constantly.  
> - [ ] Increasing spike efficiency only on connections which helps neuron to generate spike
